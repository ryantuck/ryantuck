# Ryan Tuck

Hello, world.

### Some technical links

- My website is http://ryantuck.io and it's hosted on replit. That links out to all sorts of stuff. [Here](https://github.com/ryantuck/website#readme) is how it's all set up.
- I've asked [63 questions on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1700270/ryantuck?tab=questions) and have also [answered 29](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1700270/ryantuck?tab=answers) - this is probably the best collection of my technical writing. I strongly recommend asking questions online to hone this skill.
- [108 words translated into 8 different languages](https://github.com/ryantuck/translate-words/blob/master/output.csv)
- These are my [notes for setting up a new macOS machine](https://gist.github.com/ryantuck/73b8df1b2aa728af01bc47ac364a205a)
- Some [Bingo probabilities in ipython](https://github.com/ryantuck/bingo/blob/master/scratch.ipynb)
- A python jigsaw puzzle generator: https://github.com/ryantuck/puzz
- My friend Danny Kern and I built the world's best LED rave gear from 2012-2014, but [only raised $17k on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/litlitlit/halo-rave-gear-revolutionized) and couldn't fund an initial production round. Here's the source code if you want to pick up the torch: https://github.com/ryantuck/lit-halo
