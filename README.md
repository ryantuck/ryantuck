## Professional

Here is a [**2024 PDF Resume**](https://ryantuck.io/resume.pdf).

Or `curl` it:

```sh
curl -L ryantuck.io/resume.json | jq
```

### 2022 to present - Horizon3.ai

My latest role has been managing the backend team at this series-C cybersecurity startup. GraphQL, Neo4j, etc.

### 2020 to 2022 - Songspace

I worked as a data engineer at Songspace, where I led the Data Exchange team responsible for data ingestion and exports. Serverless framework, lambda, pydantic (and typer), functional programming, jq, make, and good old unix pipes.

### 2015 to 2020 - Warby Parker

Warby Parker offered me my first official programming job back in 2015, where I went in five years from junior engineer to tech lead of data engineering, focused on Business Intelligence. I did just about everything while there was runway to work on anything, and did really good work. Here's [an interview I did](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/data-engineer-warby-parker/) with Codecademy about some of it. SQL, python, dbt, AWS, GCP, BigQuery, PostgreSQL, Looker.

### 2012 to 2014 - LIT

My friend Danny Kern and I built the world's best LED rave gear, but [only raised $17k on Kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/litlitlit/halo-rave-gear-revolutionized) and couldn't fund an initial production round. [Here's the Arduino-friendly source code repo](https://github.com/ryantuck/lit-halo) if you want to pick up the torch. Premature optimization is the root of all evil. C++, Arduino, PCB design, electrical engineering - hacking, really.

### 2007 to 2012 - College

I attended Northeastern University, studied physics and philosophy, and have a diploma to prove it sitting somewhere in my organized basement.
